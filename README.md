**Cross-Chain Agent Marketplace.**

Project Overview
• A decentralized marketplace where costumers browse, deploy, and monetize AI-powered blockchain agents that automate cross-chain workflows.
• Agents run on multiple EVM-compatible chains via Avail Nexus SDK, with revenue settlements in PYUSD and analytics provided by Blockscout.
• Key value: Costumers get plug-and-play AI automation without in-house blockchain expertise; developers earn ongoing fees via revenue sharing.
